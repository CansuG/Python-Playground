#Chapter 3: Data cleaning exercise

### Sales department performance analysis

The HR department wants to analyze the performance of the employees in the sales department.

### Data Reading
Rachel wrote a text file employee_revenue.txt including all necessary information, but she needs help to extract the necessary information.

Start by uploading the employee_revenue file to the working directory.

ðŸ“Œ Use the .read() method to open the text file in read mode and assign it to the variable "data".
"""

#Open the file in read mode
file = open("/content/employee_revenue.txt", "r")
data = file.read()

#Print the data
print(data)

"""### Data Cleaning

You can see that the data needs to be cleaned and information has to be extracted from these lines. 

To be able to clean the data, you need to separate the text into lines.

ðŸ“Œ Use the .splitlines() method.
"""

#Seperate the data into lines
lines = data.splitlines()
print(lines)

"""### Clean the data line by line

Start to clean the data for the first line.

ðŸ“Œ Use the .strip() method to remove the whitespaces from the edges of the string.
"""

#Take the first line
string = lines[0]
print(string)

#Remove the whitespaces from the edges
string = string.strip(" ")
print(string)

"""Next, you need to fix the capitalization issues.

ðŸ“Œ Use the .lower() method to convert the text to lowercase.

ðŸ“Œ Then use the .capitalize() method to capitalize the first letter.
"""

#Convert the string to lowercase
string = string.lower()
string

#Capitalize the first character
string = string.capitalize()
string

"""### Information Extraction

To extract the information, you need to split the sentence into words. 

ðŸ“Œ Use the .split() method.

"""

#Split the sentece into words
split_string = string.split(" ")
split_string

"""You might noticed that the first element in the list is the name and the third element is the number of calls.

ðŸ“Œ Use the indeces to extract the name and number of calls.
"""

#Use the index 0 to access the name element
name = split_string[0]
name

#Use the index 2 to access the number of calls element
call_number = split_string[2]
call_number

"""So far so good!

But as you can see the sentence order is not the same after the 7th element.

To extract the average deal size you need to come up with a different approach. You can use the "$" sign to find the corresponding element.

ðŸ“Œ Loop over the list to find the element that includes the "$" sign.

ðŸ“Œ Then, use the .split() method to divide the string into the number and the $ sign.
"""

#Find the element with the "$" sign
for i in split_string:
  #Divide the number from it
  if "$" in i:
    average_deal_size = i.split("$")[0]
#Print the average deal size
average_deal_size

"""Similarly, we can use the string "dollars" to extract the revenue, which is the element right before "dollars".

ðŸ“Œ Use the .index() method to identify the index for the "dollars" element.

ðŸ“Œ Then, use this index to specify and extract the revenue.
"""

#Find the index of element "dollars"
dollars_index = split_string.index("dollars")
dollars_index

#Subtract one from the index to identify the index of the revenue element
revenue_index = dollars_index - 1
revenue_index

#Extract the revenue
revenue = split_string[revenue_index]
revenue

"""Great! You extracted all necessary information.

ðŸ“Œ Print the information and check the types of the data.
"""

#Print out the extracted information
print("Name:", name)
print("Number of calls:", call_number)
print("Average deal size:", average_deal_size)
print("Revenue:", revenue)

#Check the types
print("Name type:", type(name))
print("Number of calls type:", type(call_number))
print("Average deal size type:", type(average_deal_size))
print("Revenue type:", type(revenue))

"""As you can see, we have the type string for all the data, but the average deal size, number of calls, and the revenue need to be integers. 

ðŸ“Œ Convert the data using the int() function and check again.
"""

"""Now, you need to apply all the methods and functions to the list that contains the different strings of all employees.

ðŸ“Œ Create an empty lists for storing names, number of calls, average deal sizes, and revenues.

ðŸ“Œ Use a for loop to iterate through the list with the whole data.

ðŸ“Œ Print out the necessary information.
